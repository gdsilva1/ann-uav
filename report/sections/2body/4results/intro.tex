\chapter{Results and Discussion}\label{sec:results}

This chapter shows the results obtained with the \gls*{nn} modeling.
For both cases (\gls*{shm} and \gls*{uav}) the first approach is the model itself, showing the metrics and evaluating them.
The second one is a comparison from the true label and the predict label for a random sample.
Finally, a discussion is made based on the obtained results.
