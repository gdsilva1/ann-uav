\chapter{Methodology}\label{sec:methodology}

There are two main AI perspectives and according to \textcite{winston1992}:
%
\begin{citacao}[english]
    The engineering goal of artificial intelligence is to solve real-world problems using artificial intelligence as an armamentarium of ideas about representing knowledge, using knowledge and assembly systems. The scientific goal of artificial intelligence is to which ideas about representing knowledge, using knowledge and assembly systems explains various sorts of intelligence.
\end{citacao}
The current objective is to approach AI from an engineering perspective. 
Hence, the code implementation will be pragmatic, and the lines of code will not be fully explained. 
The framework methods will not be elaborated on either, but their documentation is reasonably comprehensive for individuals with prior programming knowledge, especially in Python and MATLAB. 
Links to documentation will be provided whenever possible.
