\section{Softwares}

\subsection{\matlab}

The standard in the engineering industry, \matlab is a powerful toolbox that can be used to several activities.
Since applications in fields like medicine and biology \citep{demirkaya2009}, like image processing, until the most complex problems in engineering \citep{bansal}, that involve matrix operation and control simulation, \matlab has lots of tools that aid to solve problems.

\citet{geronel2023} used \matlab to develop their algorithm, hence the data generation will be done with it.

\subsection{PyTorch}

A framework is a group of libraries for a programming language that implements a lot of tools to facilitate some tasks. 
There is a lot of deep learning ones available and the most popular ones are TensorFlow \citep{abadi2016} and PyTorch \citep{paszke2019}. 
While the first one was developed by Google and released in 2015 the second one was developed by Meta (Facebook), although it is now under the Linux Foundation umbrella, and released in 2016, being both open-source.
Many companies, like Uber \citep{goodman2017} and Tesla \citep{pytorch2019}, use PyTorch in their \gls*{ai} team, while companies like Coca-Cola uses TensorFlow \citep{tensorflow2018}.
This means that both are trustful frameworks to rely upon their built-in functions.
PyTorch will be used to develop all the \gls*{nn}.
