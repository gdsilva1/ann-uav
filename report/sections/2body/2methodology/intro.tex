\chapter{Methodology}\label{sec:methodology}

This chapter deals with the history, the main concepts and some practical cases of \gls*{shm} inside the industry and academic area. 
Next, in the dynamic field, it will be studied the main mechanical concepts to get the necessary understanding to a \gls*{uav} motion as well the basics to know how a \gls*{uav} can be controlled.
Then, it will be shown the mathematics behind the algorithms of deep learning that will be implemented in the \cref{sec:results}. 
Finally, the way how the algorithms are going to be implemented and the tools necessary to achieve the desired neural network.
