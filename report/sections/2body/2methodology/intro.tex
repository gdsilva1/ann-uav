\chapter{Methodology}\label{sec:methodology}

This chapter deals with the mathematics behind the algorithms that will be implemented in the \cref{sec:results}. Naturally, the theory here explained can be implemented in any programming language, however in this research all the code will be done with Python, using the PyTorch framework for \gls*{ml}, and MATLAB, using its built-in functions.
