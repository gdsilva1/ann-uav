The present report approaches a way to improve smart systems. Through artificial intelligence applied in the mechanical engineering field, it provides a consistent algorithm that can reads data, trains the machine and provides results about the situation and what to do with it. It will be studied two cases, one of them using machine learning classical techniques to determine the forces applied to a unnamed aerial vehicle and other using deep learning techniques like neural networks in the structural health monitoring area.
