\section{Deep Learning}\label{sec:deep_learning}

\gls*{ml} is a branch of the \gls*{ai} area. The human being is capable to learn thing throughout its life and this concept is extrapoled to a machine. This way, as someone who's exposed and trained to assimilate some knowledge, so does a machine, not using the same method, but with a similar and parallel concept.

\begin{equation}
    \int_0^{\infty} f(x) \, e^{-st} \dd{t} = \mathcal{L}\{f(x)\}
\end{equation}

\gls*{ml} is used in several fields, such as, web searches, content filtering, social networks, e-commerce websites and also in image analysis thorugh cameras or smartphones. The systems coupled in this machines are able to identify stuff and match items based on previous data and provide to the final user things of its concern. The main technique behind this is the deep learning \citep{lecun_deep_2015}.
