\chapter{Literature Review}\label{sec:literature_review}

This chapter deals with the history, the main concepts and some practical cases of SHM inside the industry and academic area, besides showing how it may be used in the railway crack detection context.
Next, in the dynamic field, it will be studied the main mechanical concepts to get the necessary understanding to an UAV motion as well the basics to know how an UAV can be controlled.
Then, it will be shown the mathematics behind the algorithms of deep learning that will be implemented in the \cref{sec:results}. 
Finally, the way how the algorithms are going to be implemented and the tools necessary to achieve the desired NN.
