        \item UAV applications: sports, partys, get in places where human intervation might be difficult.
        \item Main goal: detecting cracks in a railway track using concepts of image processing.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Study's based in India.
        \item There's a vast railway network.
        \item It's been increasing in a rapid pace, however its infrastructure's not been able to follow it. 
        \item It causes  severe loss of valuable human life and property.

    Techniques used for damage detection:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item {\color<2>{teal}{graphical inspection}};
        \item non-destructive testing technologies (acoustic emission, ultra-sonic techniques, etc); and
        \item shuddering based global methods. 
    \end{itemize}

        \begin{itemize}
            \item Reduce risk of rail accidents; and
            \item reduce manned labor required to identify cracks along railway tracks.
