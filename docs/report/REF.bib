	abstract = {Road surface monitoring more specifically crack detection on the surface of the road pavement is a complicated task which is found vital due to critical nature of roads as elements of transportation infrastructure. Cracks on the road pavement is detectable using remotely sensed imagery or car mounted platforms. UAV\&rsquo;s are also considered as useful tools for acquiring reliable information about the pavement of the road. In This paper, an automatic method for crack detection on the road pavement is proposed using acquired videos from UAV platform. Selecting key frames and generating Ortho-image, violating non road regions in the scene are removed. Then through an edge based approach hypothesis crack elements are extracted. Afterwards, through SVM based classification true cracks are detected. Developing the proposed method, the generated results show 75\% accuracy in crack detection while less than 10\% of cracks are omitted.},

It can be used for capturing live video footages for sports like cricket or football or even commercial applications. It can even be used for procuring images at places where human intervention is difficult and so, can find wide application in disaster management. This paper mainly deals with the localization of a UAV and how it can be applied for detecting cracks in a railway track using the concepts of image processing. The algorithm used for localizing the UAV is called Monte Carlo or Particle filter localization algorithm. The video taken from the UAV is processed by further extracting image frames and analyzing each of these image frames for detection of cracks along railway line. A real-time implementation of our proposed method can significantly reduce physical labor involved in crack detection and also reduces the risk of accidents.},

	abstract = {Computer vision can provide many potential advantages over manual methods of railway track inspection. Great levels of performance can be achieved through the automation of inspection using computer vision systems, as they allow scalable, quick, and cost-effective solutions to tasks otherwise unsuited to humans. At a minimum, railway track components can be objectively and quantitatively inspected, as the system does not suffer from fatigue or the subjectivity inherent with human inspectors. The digital nature of the data collection involved with a computer vision based method, archiving inspection results and trending of the data becomes feasible, leading to more advanced failure prediction models for maintenance scheduling and a more thorough understanding of railway track structure. In this research paper, a computer vision based method is presented. A system has been suggested which can periodically take images of the railway tracks and compared with the existing database of non-faulty track images on a continuous basis. If a fault arises in the track section, the system will automatically detect the fault and necessary actions can be taken, to avoid any mishappening.},

	abstract = {As the images of pavement cracks are affected by a large amount of complicated noises, such as uneven illumination and water stains, the detected cracks are discontinuous and the main body information at the edge of the cracks is easily lost. In order to solve the problem, a crack detection algorithm in pavement image based on edge information is proposed. Firstly, the image is pre-processed by the nonlinear gray-scale transform function and reconstruction filter to enhance the linear characteristic of the crack. At the same time, an adaptive thresholding method is designed to coarsely extract the cracks edge according to the gray-scale gradient feature and obtain the crack gradient information map. Secondly, the candidate edge points are obtained according to the gradient information, and the edge is detected based on the single pixel percolation processing, which is improved by using the local difference between pixels in the fixed region. Finally, complete crack is obtained by filling the crack edge. Experimental results show that the proposed method can accurately detect pavement cracks and preserve edge information.},

	abstract = {Objectives: The detection of defects or cracks in rail track plays an important role in railway management, which prevents train accidents in both summer and rainy seasons. During summer, the cracks are formed on the track which slips the train wheel. In rainy environment, the rail tracks are affected by corrosion which also produced cracks on it. Methods: In present method, the cracks or defects are detected Echo image display device or semi conduction magnetism sensor devices which consumes more time. The proposed method enhances the track image using adaptive histogram equalization technique and further features as Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) and Local Binary Pattern (LBP) feature are extracted from the enhanced rail track image. These extracted features are trained and classified using neural network classifier which classifies the rail track image into either cracked or non-cracked image. The novelty of this work is to use soft computing approach for the detection of cracks in rail tracks. This methodology is trained by several crack images which are obtained from different environment. This method automatically classifies the current image based on the trained patterns, thus improves the classification accuracy. Findings: The performance of the proposed system achieves the accuracy rate of 94.9\%, with respect to manually crack detected and segmented images.},

	abstract = {The detection of sleeper crack is very important to ensure the reliability and safety of railway system. The powerful feature learning ability of convolutional neural network (CNN) can be used to detect cracks in sleeper images. However, convolutional neural network needs a lot of computation, which will reduce the detection speed. This paper presents a two-stage algorithm for the detection of railway sleeper cracks. In the first stage, the edge detection is carried out by using the 3 x 3 neighborhood range algorithm to find out the possible crack area, and a series of mathematical morphology operations are used to eliminate the noise target in the edge detection results. In the second stage, convolution neural network is used to classify the edge detected objects accurately. Through the analysis of many images of sleepers with or without cracks, it is proved that the cracks detected by 3 x 3 neighborhood range algorithm are coarser, clearer and more continuous than those detected by Sobel algorithm and Canny algorithm. In addition, the simple CNN model can achieve high image classification accuracy through edge detection and morphological operation of the railway sleeper crack image.},

The proliferation and growing sophistication of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in recent years has opened up many new opportunities for damage mapping, due to the high spatial resolution, the resulting stereo images and derivatives, and the Ô¨Çexibility of the platform. This study provides a comprehensive review of how UAV-based damage mapping has evolved from providing simple descriptive overviews of a disaster science, to more sophisticated texture and segmentation-based approaches, and Ô¨Ånally to studies using advanced deep learning approaches, as well as multi-temporal and multi-perspective imagery to provide comprehensive damage descriptions.

Finally, recent and emerging developments are reviewed, such as recent improvements in machine learning, increasing mapping autonomy, damage mapping in interior, GPS-denied environments, the utility of UAVs for infrastructure mapping and maintenance, as well as the emergence of UAVs with robotic abilities.},

The models are non-parametric and compared to traditional approaches require few assumptions about either the prior data available or a robot‚Äôs onboard sensors. Along with allowing for localization to prior data under GPS-denied conditions, this learning approach can be coupled with an EM procedure to automatically register GPS and prior data positions.

In this paper, we use the genetic algorithm (GA) and the particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) to cope with the complexity of the problem and compute feasible and quasi-optimal trajectories for Ô¨Åxed wing UAVs in a complex 3D environment, while considering the dynamic properties of the vehicle. The characteristics of the optimal path are represented in the form of a multiobjective cost function that we developed. The paths produced are composed of line segments, circular arcs and vertical helices. We reduce the execution time of our solutions by using the ‚Äúsingle-program, multiple-data‚Äù parallel programming paradigm and we achieve real-time performance on standard commercial off-the-shelf multicore CPUs. After achieving a quasi-linear speedup of 7.3 on 8 cores and an execution time of 10 s for both algorithms, we conclude that by using a parallel implementation on standard multicore CPUs, real-time path planning for UAVs is possible. Moreover, our rigorous comparison of the two algorithms shows, with statistical signiÔ¨Åcance, that the GA produces superior trajectories to the PSO.},

These architectures have special relevance in precision applications and indoor/outdoor navigation of automatic vehicles such as Automatic Ground Vehicles (AGVs) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The positioning error of these systems is conditioned by the algorithms used in the position calculation, the quality of the time measurements, and the sensor deployment of the signal receivers. Once the algorithms have been deÔ¨Åned and the method to compute the time measurements has been selected, the only design criteria of the LPS is the distribution of the sensors in the three-dimensional space. This problem has proved to be NP-hard, and therefore a heuristic solution to the problem is recommended. In this paper, a genetic algorithm with the Ô¨Çexibility to be adapted to diÔ¨Äerent scenarios and ground modelings is proposed. This algorithm is used to determine the best node localization in order to reduce the Cram√©r-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) with a heteroscedastic noise consideration in each sensor of an Asynchronous Time DiÔ¨Äerence of Arrival (A-TDOA) architecture. The methodology proposed allows for the optimization of the 3D sensor deployment of a passive A-TDOA architecture, including ground modeling Ô¨Çexibility and heteroscedastic noise consideration with sequential iterations, and reducing the spatial discretization to achieve better results. Results show that optimization with 15\% of elitism and a Tournament 3 selection strategy oÔ¨Äers the best maximization for the algorithm.},

As UAVs can be considered as a lowcost alternative to the classical manned aerial photogrammetry, new applications in the short- and close-range domain are introduced. Rotary or fixed wing UAVs, capable of performing the photogrammetric data acquisition with amateur or SLR digital cameras, can fly in manual, semiautomated and autonomous modes. Following a typical photogrammetric workflow, 3D results like Digital Surface or Terrain Models (DTM/DSM), contours, textured 3D models, vector information, etc. can be produced, even on large areas. The paper reports the state of the art of UAV for Geomatics applications, giving an overview of different UAV platforms, applications and case studies, showing also the latest developments of UAV image processing.
