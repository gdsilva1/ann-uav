\acrfull{uav} has been used for several applications. 
It can be used for entertainment, surveillance, mapping, and also to get in places where human access might be difficult.

When the subject is Brazil, its vast application is turned into the agriculture due to the country nature. 
This way, as shown by \textcite{de2020method}, to increase the efficiency in agriculture, the use of applied computation through the image processing captured by \acrshort{uav} has been used for remote identification of animals in the field, applicable to precision livestock systems. 

Monitoring road surface to detect cracks on it is detectable by using remotely sensed imagery via static camera or car mounted platforms. As the image is captured by some camera, it's useful and reliable to equip an \acrshort{uav} with it and optimize the acquirement of the road surface image, making possible to automatize the crack detection \cite{dadrasjavan2019automatic}.
