\gls{uav} has been used for several applications. 
Historically, it was primarily designed to achieve military goals, such as unmanned inspection, surveillance, reconnaissance, and mapping of inimical areas.
Over time, its applications extended to other areas, like geomatics, for data collecting through photogrammetry. 
This way, collecting images using \gls{uav}, provides a bunch of applications in the aerial close-range domain, making it a low-cost alternative to the traditional manned aerial photogrammetry for mapping or detailed 3D recording information and being a valid complementary solution to terrestrial acquisitions \cite{nex2014uav}.
Nowadays, it can be used for entertainment, sports transmissions, commercial applications and also to get in places where human access might be difficult \cite{sushant2017localization}.
