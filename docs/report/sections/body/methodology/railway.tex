The human being always needed to move from one place to another. 
Since prehistory, either to run away from a predator or to obtain food, it's intrinsic to the humanity the idea to get out of point A to a certain point B.
As the evolution was passing, many couldn't keep themselves alive due to the sagacity of the predator, so a way to contour this was to improve the means of transportation.

Today, one of the most used means of transportation is train.
Highly used around the world to transport people as well as products, trains are one of the most important ways to get things from one place to another.
