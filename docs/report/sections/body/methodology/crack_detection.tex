\section{Crack Detection}

There are three main ways to detect cracks: graphical inspection, non-destructive testing technologies and shuddering based global methods \citep{addagatlamodern}. The \gls*{uav} usage for this purpose fits in the first way, i.e., graphical inspection.

To have a complete approach, it is needed to localize the \gls*{uav} initially. \citet{sushant2017localization} implemented a way to do it based on \gls*{mcl} method through MATLAB, where a three element vector (\(x,y,\theta\)) is provided giving the initial pose.
