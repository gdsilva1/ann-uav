\section{Scalars}

A scalar is a real number with no dimension associated to it.

\section{Vectors}

A vector is an array of number in a specific order. Each number can be identified by its index. They are represented in bold, upright serifed and lowercase letters.
%
\begin{equation}
    \symbfup{x} = \begin{Bmatrix}
        x_1 \\
        x_2 \\
        \vdots \\
        x_n
    \end{Bmatrix}
\end{equation}

\section{Matrices}

A matrix is an array of numbers  with two dimensions. Each number can be identified by two indexes, representing the row and the column where it is. They are represented in bold, upright, serifed and uppercase letters.
%
\begin{equation}
    \symbfup{A}_{m\times n} = \begin{bmatrix}
        a_{11} & a_{12} & \cdots & a_{1n} \\
        a_{21} & a_{22} & \cdots & a_{2n} \\ 
        \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
        a_{m1} & a_{m2} & \cdots & a_{mn}
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

\section{Tensors}

A tensor is an array of number with more than two dimensions. The quantity os indexes of a tensor element is the same of the dimensions of the tensor itself. They are represented in bold, upright, sans-serifed and uppercase letters: \(\symbfsfup{A}\).

Scalar is rank-0 tensor, vector is rank-1 tensor and matrix is rank-2 tensor. The term tensor is usually employed when the rank is equal or greater than 3.
