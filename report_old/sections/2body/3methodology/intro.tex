The code implementation will be pragmatical and the lines of the code will not be fully explained. The frameworks methods will not be explained either, but their documentation are reasonably comprehensive with previous programming knowledge, especially in Python and \matlab, and they are going to be linked whenever possible.

While the engineering goal of \gls*{ai} is to solve real-world problems using it as an equipment, the scientific goal is to determine which ideas explain the various sorts of intelligence \cite{winston1992} and the current objective is to use \gls*{ai} from the engineering perspective.
